# Connect-4
Connect 4 Game written in Haskell

This is my solution for the Connect 4 AI. It features a PVP mode, a mode vs a Random AI and 3 (somewhat arbitrary) levels of difficulty vs a Montecarlo Tree based AI. The board is made of integers (which I admit it is kinda weird and I am working on a better way to display them) with '1' and '2' representing both players.
